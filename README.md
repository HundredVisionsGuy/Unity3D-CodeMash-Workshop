# Intro to Unity 3D Game Development
This is a soft intro to the Unity game engine. Follow along in the labs to fix, improve, and build on a simple roller ball game.

The game you will make is a simple one, using primarily Unity primitives. The goal of the game is to roll the ball to 
the end of the level, dodging obstacles along the way.

## Pre-requisites:
### Previous Coding experience
Prior knowledge of Unity is not required, however some general progreamming knowledge is preferred(knowledge of simple things like conditionals, variables, loops, etc)
### Equipment
Unity is fairly easy to run for simple things such as this roller ball game, but it should be at least slightly better than a potato PC
- Unity offical system requirements: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html#editor
- For more in depth: https://www.cgdirector.com/unity-system-requirements/ (The minimum recommendations throughout are acceptable for this lab)

It would also be recommended to have a mouse instead of a touch pad, as that makes scene navigation easier(IMO)
### Unity
This will be done using Unity 2022.2.21. 
Since this is the basics, any version should work, but it is better to have the same version. You can download it from here:
https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#:~:text=Release%20Notes-,Unity%202022.2.21,-May%2024%2C%202023 (Unity Hub recommended, but not needed)
 - Follow this video till the end for steps to install, starting at 2:19: https://youtu.be/Kh_FD0Ypdhg?t=139
 - This Method will also install an IDE, VS Community, which will be hooked up to Unity by default
 - For Mac users, you need to check "Mac Build Support (Mono)" and uncheck "Windows Build Support"
 - For Linux, to install Unity Hub: https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux
 - For the purpose of this tutorial, Linux users can choose either mono or IL2CPP when choosing "Linux Build Support" in the modules
### IDE
You will also need something to edit the code. If you followed the above steps, VS Community should be installed. You can also feel free to install VS Code or Jet brains Rider
 - https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingToolsIDEs.html#:~:text=Unity%20supports%20the%20following%20IDEs,JetBrains%20Rider
 - The link also explains how to hook up the IDE to the editor, which can be done when testing your setup in a few moments
### Git
You can manage without Git but it is recommended to have it installed. If you clone using Git there will be progress branches to help stay on pace
 - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
### Cloning the project
With Git installed, you can clone the project.
 - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Or you can download as a ZIP
## How to test if it works
It shoild work just fine, but always good to make sure :)
- In the Unity Hub, at the top right of the window click "open"
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project, and open "RockPaperScissors" in the main folder
- Once Unity loads, click the "console" tab in the bottom of the window next to "assets" to view game results
- Click the play button at the top of the editor
- If you can play the game, you're all set!

## Labs

## Where to go next
- suggest things like courses, resources and to keep doing your own projects, ie dont get stuck in tutorial hell
