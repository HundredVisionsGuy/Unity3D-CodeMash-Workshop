# Intro to Unity 3D Game Development
This is a soft intro to the Unity game engine. Follow along in the labs to fix, improve, and build on a simple roller ball game.

The game you will make is a simple one where the goal is to roll the ball to the end of the level, dodging obstacles along the way. Your
goal in learning is not to dive super deep into a few places, but to get your toes wet in many aspects of game development in Unity, 
giving you the knowledge to continue to learn and grow on your own.

## Pre-requisites:
### Previous Coding experience
Prior knowledge of Unity is not required, however some general programming knowledge is preferred(things like conditionals, variables, loops, etc)
### Equipment
You'll need a laptop(if attending in person) or desktop with Windows, Linux, or Mac installed
- Unity offical system requirements: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html#editor
- For more in depth: https://www.cgdirector.com/unity-system-requirements/ (The minimum recommendations throughout are acceptable for this lab)

It would also be recommended to have a mouse instead of a touch pad, as that makes scene navigation easier(IMO)
### Unity
This will be done using Unity 2021.3.6. 
Since this is the basics, any version should work, but it is better to have the same version. You can download it from here: [Unity Download](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) (Unity Hub recommended, but not needed)
 - Follow this video till the end for steps to install, starting at 2:19: https://youtu.be/Kh_FD0Ypdhg?t=139
 - This Method will also install an IDE, VS Community, which will be hooked up to Unity by default
 - In one lab we will build and upload a web build so in the modules make sure to include "WebGL Build Support"
For builds to run on your local machine you can do that following. Windows can leave as default
 - For Mac users, you need to check "Mac Build Support (Mono)" and uncheck "Windows Build Support"
 - For Linux, to install Unity Hub: https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux
 - For the purpose of this tutorial, Linux users can choose either mono or IL2CPP when choosing "Linux Build Support" in the modules
### IDE
You will also need something to edit the code. If you followed the above steps, VS Community should be installed. You can also feel free to install VS Code or Jet brains Rider
 - https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingToolsIDEs.html#:~:text=Unity%20supports%20the%20following%20IDEs,JetBrains%20Rider
 - The link also explains how to hook up the IDE to the editor, which can be done when testing your setup in a few moments
### Git
You can manage without Git but it is recommended to have it installed. If you clone using Git there will be progress branches to help stay on pace
 - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
### Cloning the project
With Git installed, you can clone the project.
 - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Or you can download as a ZIP
## How to test if it works
It should work just fine, but always good to make sure :)
- In the Unity Hub, at the top right of the window click "open"
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project, and open "RockPaperScissors" in the main folder
- Once Unity loads, if the game is not on the center screen click the "assets" tab in the bottom of the window next to "console"
- Double click to enter the "scenes" folder, then double click the "Main" scene
- Once on the game scene, click the "console" tab in the bottom of the window to view game results
- Click the play button at the top of the editor
- If you can play the game, you're all set!
