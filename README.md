# Intro to Unity 3D Game Development
Welcome to an intro to Unity 3D! Follow along in the labs to fix, improve, and build on a simple roller ball game.

The game you will make is a simple one where the goal is to roll the ball to the end of the level, dodging obstacles along the way. This game may be simple
but you will learn about and engage with many key aspects of game development including programming for obstacles, player controls, and more, UI, Collision, and building your game.

Follow all the steps below _**before starting the training**_ so you are prepared and ready to dive in!

## Pre-requisites:
***IMPORTANT: Installation can take a decent bit of time, so make sure everything is installed and ready to go ahead of time!!!***  
If you need any help installing ping "@Mason Beale" in the CodeMash [Discord](https://discord.gg/RbZENJ8c73)

### Previous knowledge
- No knowledge of Unity needed
- At least some object oriented programming experience is highly recommended. We will be using basics such as but not limited to: functions, classes, conditionals, variables and loops.
- Knoweledge of Git/GitHub is preferred, but not required
### Equipment
You'll need a laptop(if attending in person) or desktop with Windows, Linux, or Mac installed
- Unity can run decently well on most laptops, even if they are not super powerful, as long as they aren't already super slow even with things like browsing the internet, but especially for the game we will make, it is not super power intensive
  - Unity official system requirements: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html#editor
  - For more in depth and specifics about RAM, CPU, etc vist here: https://www.cgdirector.com/unity-system-requirements/
    - One quote from that article worth mentioning: "It definitely doesnâ€™t need the latest and greatest hardware, and you can run it just fine on anything released in the last 5 years" (and probably even a few more years than that for what we are doing, but better to be safe)

It would also be recommended to have a mouse instead of a touch pad, as that makes scene navigation easier(IMO)
### Unity
This will be done using Unity 2021.3.6. 
Since this is the basics, any version should work, but it is better to have the same version. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mbeale0/Unity3D-CodeMash-Workhop/blob/master/installation.md) to install Unity.

### IDE
You will also need something to edit the code. If you followed the above steps, VS Community should be installed though you may want to double check it is hooked up. You can also feel free to install VS Code or Jet brains Rider(free trial) instead. 
 - VS community should be hooked up automatically, but it is never a bad idea to be sure
 - You can hook up your IDE, or make sure it is hooked up, when testing the install throught the Rock Paper Scissors game here in a few minutes, once you have the Editor itself open
 - Instructions on hooking up your IDE at this [link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingToolsIDEs.html#:~:text=Unity%20supports%20the%20following%20IDEs,JetBrains%20Rider) 

Also worth noting, Intellisense/compiler error warnings and such should be set up automatically especially if using VS community, but I have had some issues with dotnet on Linux for that info, so it may be worth it to create a very simple "Hello world" dotnet program to see if you get things like intellisense and the red squiggles, as this is(usually) not a direct issue with Unity.

### Git
You can manage without Git but it is recommended to have it installed. If you clone using Git there will be progress branches to help stay on pace
 - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
### Cloning the project
This repo contains a test project and a starter project for the training, so you need the files.

With Git installed, you can clone the project.
 - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Or you can download as a ZIP
## How to test if it works
It should work just fine, but always good to make sure :) Also a good time to make sure your IDE is hooked up
- In the Unity Hub, at the top right of the window click "Add"
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project, and open "RockPaperScissors" in the main folder
- In the middle of the "Projects" tab in the Hub, click "RockPaperScissors" to open the Unity project, and wait for the Editor to open(this might take a minute)
  - The project you are loading is also where you can set up your IDE as mentioned above
- Once Unity loads in the middle window select the "Game" tab next to the "Scene" tab
    - If you see this pop up:  
       ![SkipNewVersion](https://github.com/mbeale0/Unity3D-CodeMash-Workhop/assets/74221606/cc259896-784a-4fe8-b49b-357a206abcaf)
    - Click, "Skip new Version"
- If you see a blank screen on this game tab, open the the "assets" tab in the bottom of the window next to "console"
- From the assets tab, double click to enter the "scenes" folder, then double click the "Main" scene to open that scene
- Once on the proper game scene, click the "console" tab in the bottom of the window to view game results
- Click the play button at the very top of the editor
- If you can play the game, you're all set!

## Finishing Set-Up
We also need to add the main project just like we did above, since there is a small amount of starter content for the actual workshop
Just like before:
   In the Unity Hub, at the top right of the window click "Add"
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project, and open "RollerBall" in the main folder
- You're all set! See you at the Kalahari!
