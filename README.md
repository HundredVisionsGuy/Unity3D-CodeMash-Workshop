# Intro to Unity 3D Game Development
This is a soft intro to the Unity game engine. Follow along in the labs to fix, improve, and build on a simple roller ball game.

The game you are trying to make is a simple one, using primarily Unity primitives. The goal of the game is to roll the ball to 
the end of the level, dodging obstacles along the way.

## Pre-requisites:
### Unity
This will be done using Unity 202x.X.X, but in theory any version should work, but you can downlaod this version from here:
Add URL
 - add/attach/write tutorial on how to install, including for different OS's
 - I will be working off of Windows, but Linux and MacOS should work fine
### IDE
You will also need something to edit the code, either VS Code or VS community, I wil be using VS code since it is more lightweight:
Add Url(s)
 - add link how to install and attach to Unity
### Git
- and link and tutorial to download(for cloning

## Cloning the base project
- add tutorial

## How to test if it works
- probably something like have a super mini game and have them build and run it
