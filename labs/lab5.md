# Win and lose UI
With a longer level, basic winning/losing and obstacles, we have a fairly solid base game. If we were doing a simple versioning, this would be like version 1. A basic minimum viable product. I think it's time to start working on "verssion 2" to keep with that analogy, and flesh out the game a bit. A quick and easy way to this is to have some simple UI when we win and lose so a real player could more easily play again, or quit. (right now we can easily do that in the Editor where we have a play button. That doesn't exist in a build).

## Adding the UI
// Have them add a canvas
// Explain Canvas and Event system
  // Scale with screen size
// Add Text
  // Edit/adjust text
  // Custom fonts
// Add buttons
  // Edit/adjust Buttons
  // Custom UI 

## Adding the code
// Create GameManagerScript
  // public function to end game
// MenuMangerScript to handle buttons
