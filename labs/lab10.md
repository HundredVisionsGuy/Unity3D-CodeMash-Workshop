# Building our game and uploading to GameJolt
Congrats! You have made a complete and full game, which is something even many passionate game developers struggle with. Way to go!

Of course, when we make a new project, its super fun to let other people play it, so let's actualyl build our game(so the person doesn't need Unity) and to make it even easier, we will upload it as a WebGL build to gamejolt so it will be super easy to share online, and free!
